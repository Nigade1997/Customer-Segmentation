# Customer-Segmentation
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement an interactive dashboard using Tableau to visualize and analyze key banking data, such as account balances, transactions, deposits, withdrawals, and customer insights. The dashboard will help bank managers and analysts make data-driven decisions by providing easy access to critical financial data, monitoring customer activity, and improving operational efficiency.
Tools & Technologies:

Tableau Desktop/Server: For building and publishing the dashboard.

SQL: For querying the bank’s database and pulling relevant financial data.

Data Connections: Integration with the bank’s existing databases (e.g., SQL Server, Oracle) to ensure real-time data updates.

Conclusion:
The Bank Details Dashboard in Tableau will streamline data analysis, improve decision-making, and provide a clear view of the bank’s financial health. By integrating various data sources and offering an intuitive user interface, this dashboard will become an essential tool for bank personnel to optimize their operations and enhance customer experiences.
